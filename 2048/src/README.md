# AI-Driven 2048 Game Solver

## Overview
This project presents an AI-driven approach to playing and solving the 2048 game, a popular single-player sliding block puzzle game. The core of the project is a Python script that uses machine learning algorithms, implemented with TensorFlow and Keras, to predict and perform optimal moves in the game. The goal of this AI solver is not just to play the game, but to do so efficiently, learning over time to maximize the score.

## Features
- **Game Logic Implementation**: A `Game2048` class that simulates the 2048 game mechanics, including initiating a new game, processing player moves (up, down, left, right), and checking for game-ending conditions.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Utilizes TensorFlow and Keras to build a neural network that learns to predict the best moves based on the current state of the game board.
- **Automated Gameplay**: The script plays the game automatically by making predictions for the next best move. It adapts its strategy based on the outcomes of previous games to improve performance.
- **Game Status Evaluation**: The AI assesses the game state after each move to determine whether it has won, lost, or should continue playing.
- **Customizable Game Settings**: Allows modifications to game parameters such as board size and target score, offering flexibility and the ability to test the AI under different conditions.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for implementing the game logic and AI model.
- **TensorFlow**: An open-source machine learning library used for building the neural network model.
- **Keras**: A high-level neural networks API, running on top of TensorFlow, used for fast experimentation with deep neural networks.
- **NumPy**: A fundamental package for scientific computing in Python, used for handling arrays and mathematical operations.

## How the AI Works
The AI operates by continuously updating its strategy based on the feedback from each move's outcome. It uses a neural network to evaluate the game board and predict the most promising move. The model improves through repeated gameplay, learning from past moves to increase the chances of achieving higher scores in subsequent games.

## Future Scope
- **Enhanced Learning Algorithms**: Implementing more sophisticated algorithms to improve the AI's learning rate and decision-making process.
- **GUI Integration**: Developing a graphical user interface for a more interactive and visually appealing gameplay experience.
- **Performance Optimization**: Refining the model and game logic for faster computations and better performance.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques in game strategy development, specifically for the 2048 game. It offers an intriguing look into how AI can be trained to not only play but also excel in strategic games.
