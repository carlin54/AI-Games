# Minesweeper AI Solver

## Overview
This project is a Minesweeper AI Solver designed to play and solve Minesweeper games using machine learning. It consists of Python scripts that implement the Minesweeper game logic, generate training data, and use neural network models to predict and perform the most optimal moves. The goal of this solver is to efficiently play Minesweeper, learning and adapting its strategy to maximize the chances of winning.

## Features
- **Minesweeper Game Implementation**: Includes a `Minesweeper` class to simulate the game's mechanics.
- **Training Data Generation**: Functions to generate and save training data based on gameplay.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Includes several models (`MinesweeperModel9`, `MinesweeperModel11`, etc.) to learn and predict the best moves.
- **Automated Gameplay and Testing**: The ability to automatically play multiple games and test the models' performance.
- **Model Training and Saving**: Functionalities to train models with new data and save the trained models for future use.
- **Game Results Analysis**: Storing and analyzing the game results to evaluate the models' effectiveness.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language for implementing the game logic and AI models.
- **TensorFlow**: Utilized for creating and training neural network models.
- **Keras**: High-level API for neural network development, built on top of TensorFlow.
- **NumPy**: Essential for handling arrays and matrix operations, crucial in game state representation and manipulations.

## Model Training and Evaluation
The models are trained using generated game data, where they learn to predict safe moves based on the game's state. After training, the models are evaluated by testing them in a set number of games, and their performance (win rate) is analyzed.

## Running the Solver
- Ensure all dependencies are installed.
- Use the provided scripts to generate training data, train models, and test them in games.
- Observe the models' performance and make adjustments to the training process as necessary.

## Future Enhancements
- **Advanced Learning Techniques**: Implementing more complex algorithms or neural network architectures.
- **GUI Development**: Adding a graphical user interface for more interactive gameplay.
- **Performance Optimization**: Further optimizing the models for better accuracy and efficiency.

## Conclusion
This Minesweeper AI Solver demonstrates the capability of machine learning in strategic game-solving. It provides insights into how AI can be trained to tackle problems with a defined rule set and unpredictable outcomes.
